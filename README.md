# 📊 Panel Regression for Poverty Reduction in West Java  
🏆 Finalist – IPB Mathematics Challenge (IMC 2024)

This project applies a **panel data regression model** to analyze poverty in West Java (2019–2023), aiming to support **SDG No. 1 – No Poverty** through data-driven policy insights.

---

## 🎯 Objective  
To identify the most influential socio-economic factors affecting poverty in 27 districts/cities in West Java.

---

## 🔍 Key Findings  
- **Significant variables**:  
  - 📈 **Life Expectancy (UHH)** → *positive* correlation with poverty  
  - 💸 **Expenditure** → *negative* correlation with poverty  
- Education, labor force, and sanitation were **not significant**
- Model explains **41.45%** of poverty variation

📌 *Higher life expectancy correlates with higher poverty due to unequal healthcare access.*

---

## 💡 Policy Implication  
Focus on **equal healthcare access** and **increasing income** to effectively reduce poverty.

## ⚙️ Tools  
- Python
